# AGENTS

x-tools is a set of tools for coding agents, implemented once and
delivered to several harnesses (OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build,
Antigravity, Hermes Agent) from this repository. Releases are GitHub Releases
tagged `v<version>`; consumers pin a tag or the same npm version.

## Layout

- `src/project.ts` — the package's identity: name, tool ID prefix, setting
  prefix and toolsets. The Hermes plugin's counterpart is `project.py` in its
  package.
- `src/core/` — the tool contract and the tools. Each tool is a spec with a
  Zod v4 argument schema, an output schema, a toolset and a write class;
  `execute` gets a `ToolContext`.
- `src/<entry>/` — one thin entry point per delivery, which turns the specs
  into that harness's tools: `src/opencode/` (native plugin), `src/mcp/` (the
  stdio MCP server the other plugins bundle), and `src/cli/`, the command line
  the Hermes plugin (Python, in `src/hermes/`) calls.
- `docs/conventions.md` — the rules every tool follows.
- Tests sit beside the code they test (`*.test.ts`, `bun test`).

## Rules

- **Every tool follows [`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md).** A
  change to a convention changes that file first, with its reason.
- **`src/core/` knows no harness, no caller and no project.** No harness,
  product or machine names, paths or session conventions in code,
  descriptions or messages; the project's names reach it only through the
  entry points. It uses `node:*` modules only, never a runtime's own globals,
  so it runs on Node and Bun.

- **Tool IDs are a public interface.** Permission rules and skills key on them
  (`<prefix>_<domain>_<verb>`); renaming one is a breaking change.
- **A tool's write class is its contract with the harness.** The class sets
  the annotations every entry point publishes, so it must be the strictest
  class the tool's arguments can reach. `read_only` registers no write tool;
  annotations are hints, never the boundary.
- **Every program a tool runs goes through one runner**, which fixes a
  non-interactive environment and maps failures to error codes.
- **Nothing writes to X.** No tool, method or argument posts, replies, likes,
  reposts, follows, bookmarks or sends; the one write is a download to the
  machine. A reader that cannot write cannot be steered into acting on the
  account.
- **Every read goes through the source choice, then the engine call or the
  FxTwitter client, each with its pacing.** A tool never starts the bridge,
  opens the state files or contacts x.com or FxTwitter itself; otherwise a
  read escapes the caps and the remembered refusal that keep the reading
  account alive, or skips FxTwitter where it should have been read first.
- **Every result names its source**, and `source: fxtwitter`,
  `source: account` and `account_only` are kept to the letter: a caller that
  asked for no third party must never reach one.
- **Cookies never leave the engine call.** They are never an argument, a
  setting, a tool's input, a result, an error or a log line, and reach the
  bridge only on its standard input. Tests use made-up values.
- **No test reaches X or FxTwitter.** The bridge is tested against a fake
  twscrape, the engine call against a fake bridge, and the FxTwitter client
  against a fake FxTwitter.
- **Every commit stays small.** The pre-commit hook rejects a commit over 500
  reviewable changed lines; split the change instead of raising the limit.
